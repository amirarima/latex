\section{Introduction}
An audio signal is a representation of sound, typically as an
electrical voltage. Audio signals have frequencies in the audio
frequency range of roughly 20 to 20,000 Hz (the limits of human
hearing)~\cite{Boney96}.
Audio signals may be synthesized directly, or may originate at a
transducer such as a microphone, musical instrument pickup,
phonograph cartridge, or tape head. Loudspeakers or headphones
convert an electrical audio signal into sound. Digital
representations of audio signals exist in a variety of
formats~\cite{MG,HK,Pan}.
